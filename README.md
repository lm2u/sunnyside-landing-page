## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The key learnings I've acquired while making this project are:

- Navbar overlapping the hero section
- Improved understanding of positions
- Changing svg color using css filter()
- Creating a hamburger menu with a popup
- Creating a triangle decoration
- Alternatives to changing background image on mobile/desktop

### Continued development

I'm still not completely comfortable with CSS positions and how to structure the HTML while using the mobile-first approach in the development.

What could be improved on maybe the unnecessary bloat in HTML because literally almost everything has a class name... Although I'm still not sure if it's necessary or not, since I'm just trying which naming conventions would be appropriate for my style.
